### Description

Updated from IniViewer. This code opens ini files and places its contents in a tree node. You can edit, delete, or insert new Sections/Keys/Values with this. I will make changes to this if it is needed. Please let me know what you think of it. I would also appreciate any votes you could give me.

* One thing to note is that this editor will only make changes to Sections/Keys/Values. If there are any comments in the ini file, they will be lost on saving. I might add some code to look for comments or any other bogus stuff in the file later on. Let me know if you think it is needed.
